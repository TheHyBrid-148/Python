This repository covers the basics to complex concepts and methods regarding python.

If you haven't had python or pycharm installed yet, first will be windows (5) then second will be MacOS (12).

For Windows:
1. Go to python.org and under downloads, install python for windows
2. After installing the application in a file storage, download pycharm
3. Go to jetbrains/pycharm/ and under windows, download pycharm for the community version
4. Run the app, and you're all set.


For MacOS:
1. Go to python.org and under downloads, install the latest verion of python for Mac
2. Just like number 2 in the Windows method, download pycharm then.
3. Go to jetbrains/pycharm/ and under MacOS, you will have to choose if your laptop runs on Intel or Apple Silicon.
4. To determine whether your laptop runs on Intel or Apple Silicon, click the Apple logo on the top left corner, select "About this Mac", then check the processor
   information if it says Intel, if not you have an Apple-based system
5. Once Pycharm has been set, you're good to go.

If you want an easier way, you can just simply download visual studio code.

Have fun on the full overview and I hope you learn something/a lot. :))
